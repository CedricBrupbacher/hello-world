Hello world repository

Cedric here. I am an up and comming game developer and these are my first steps towards that goal.
I'm getting a Bachelors degree in Game developemnt right now and am trying to get as much hands on experience as humanly possible by attending Gamejams or figuring things out for myself on private projects.
